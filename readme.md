## Description

### Objectives
* Create a new web page for an animal shelter. List out the animals available to be adopted, including pictures and descriptions of each animal. Have at least 3-5 animals listed. Don't forget to set up a git repository, make frequent commits and push to a remote repository on GitHub.
* Display each animal's "profile" in a column.
* Change the styles of elements nested within the columns using the idea of cascading.
* Find other places in your web pages where you can change elements on the page according to cascading precedence.
* Center some elements on the page.

_{Leave nothing to chance! You want it to be easy for potential users, employers and collaborators to run your app. Do I need to run a server? How should I set up my databases? Is there other code this application depends on? We recommend deleting the project from your desktop, re-cloning the project from GitHub, and writing down all the steps necessary to get the project working again.}_

## Known Bugs

* _Any known issues_
